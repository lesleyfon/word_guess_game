# Word_guess_game
The word guessing game is a game where pick a random number and the computer picks a ramdon number, if both letters  are a match, then you get a point, if not you loose a point. I started of by Naming the title of the page [The psycic game], after that i inserted  some links that link some external files to the html i.e.  the style links and the javascript links. the javascript link usually comes at the bottom of the body tag. 
After that i wrote a series of "p" tags do display the rules of the game and the scores of the game. i wrote some javascript in the game.js file so that when the you guess a letter correctly or  chose a wrong number you losses or wins increase.
